Reason React Playground
-----------------------

Reason React with editable source and live preview. Based on
[reasonml.github.io](https://github.com/reasonml/reasonml.github.io),
[BuckleScript
playground](https://github.com/BuckleScript/bucklescript-playground), and
[react-toolbox.com](http://react-toolbox.com/).

It uses a [patched version](https://github.com/astrada/bucklescript/tree/ppx)
of the BuckleScript compiler to load external modules (.cmi files), and to
rewrite OCaml code with JSX extensions.
